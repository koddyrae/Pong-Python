# Pong-Python
Simple Python game using Turtle module

This is a simple python game that I learned to make using the Turtle module of Python. It was made with the intentions of being one of my first solo projects since I love playing games, so I wanted to try making one.

This was made by following a YouTube video from freeCodeCamp, but after following the video, I have started to add my own code onto the game to make it my own and mess around with features that the video didn't dive into.

Features I tried to implement
- More ball randomness at beginning
- Different styling
